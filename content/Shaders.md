Shaders are small programs that run on the GPU that are responsible for generating graphics. GLSL is the shader language and the GPU converts these programs through a pipeline which the image below depicts.

### What is a Vertex?

A vertex is a collection of data per 3D coordinate.

### Vertex Shader

The first part of the pipeline is the vertex shader that takes as input a single vertex. The main purpose of the vertex shader is to transform 3D coordinates into different 3D coordinates (more on that later) and the vertex shader allows us to do some basic processing on the vertex attributes.

### Geometry Shader

The geometry shader takes as input a collection of vertices that form a primitive and has the ability to generate other shapes by emitting new vertices to form new (or other) primitive(s). In this example case, it generates a second triangle out of the given shape.

### Primitive Assembly

The primitive assembly stage takes as input all the vertices (or vertex if GL_POINTS is chosen) from the vertex (or geometry) shader that form one or more primitives and assembles all the point(s) in the primitive shape given; in this case two triangles.

### Rasterization Step

The output of the primitive assembly stage is then passed on to the rasterization stage where it maps the resulting primitive(s) to the corresponding pixels on the final screen, resulting in fragments for the fragment shader to use. Before the fragment shaders run, clipping is performed. Clipping discards all fragments that are outside your view, increasing performance.

### Fragment Shader

The main purpose of the fragment shader is to calculate the final color of a pixel and this is usually the stage where all the advanced OpenGL effects occur. Usually the fragment shader contains data about the 3D scene that it can use to calculate the final pixel color (like lights, shadows, color of the light and so on).

### Tests and Blending

After all the corresponding color values have been determined, the final object will then pass through one more stage that we call the alpha test and blending stage. This stage checks the corresponding depth (and stencil) value (we'll get to those later) of the fragment and uses those to check if the resulting fragment is in front or behind other objects and should be discarded accordingly. The stage also checks for alpha values (alpha values define the opacity of an object) and blends the objects accordingly. So even if a pixel output color is calculated in the fragment shader, the final pixel color could still be something entirely different when rendering multiple triangles.
